## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. Form Data Not Persisting to Client Tiles
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & VERIFIED
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical
**Issue:** When a new client request is submitted, the form input data is not appearing on the completed client tile. Client detail modal was showing hardcoded mock data.

**Resolution:**
- [x] Audited form field names - ALL MATCH server expectations ✅
- [x] Added comprehensive debugging logging throughout the data flow ✅
- [x] Removed ALL hardcoded data from client detail modal sidebar ✅
- [x] Fully implemented updateSidebarFields() function to populate real data ✅
- [x] User testing confirmed tiles and detail modal show correct data ✅

**Completed:** October 30, 2025

**Debugging Added:**
- ✅ POST /api/clients: Log request body received
- ✅ POST /api/clients: Log clientData before database insert
- ✅ POST /api/clients: Log newClient after database insert
- ✅ GET /api/clients: Log clients fetched and sent to frontend
- ✅ Frontend: Log clients received from API
- ✅ Frontend: Log data used to create each card

**Next Steps:**
1. User submits a new client request in deployed app
2. Check Railway logs to see what data is received/stored
3. Check browser console (F12) to see what data frontend receives
4. Identify where data is lost or incorrect
5. Apply fix

**Files Modified:**
- `server.js` - Added logging to POST /api/clients and GET /api/clients
- `public/app.js` - Added logging to loadAllClients and createClientCardElement

---

### 2. Sales Team Assignment Shows "Loading" on Tiles
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & VERIFIED
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical
**Issue:** The "Assigned To" section in client detail modal was showing "Loading..." instead of the actual sales team member name.

**Root Cause:**
- Client detail modal had a `<select>` dropdown with id="detailSalesTeamSelect" that was never being populated
- The dropdown had placeholder text "Loading..." that never changed
- This was different from the New Request form dropdown which works correctly

**Resolution:**
- [x] Replaced Sales Team dropdown with text display ✅
- [x] Replaced Fulfillment Ops dropdown with text display ✅
- [x] Updated updateSidebarFields() to populate both assignment fields ✅
- [x] Added logging to verify sales_team value is being set ✅
- [x] User testing confirmed fix works ✅

**Note:** Assignment fields are now read-only text displays. Editing assignments will be implemented as part of Feature #6 (Editable Client Details).

**Completed:** October 30, 2025

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY FEATURES

### 3. Subtask Assignment to Specific People
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & VERIFIED
**Priority:** 🟠 High
**Description:** Subtasks can now be assigned to specific people when creating or editing them. Users are filtered by app-specific access control.

**Resolution:**
- [x] Add assignee dropdown when creating new subtask ✅
- [x] Dropdown shows full user names (not initials) ✅
- [x] Filters users by active access to Fulfillment app via user_app_access table ✅
- [x] Defaults to current user ✅
- [x] Allow changing assignee on existing subtasks via dropdown ✅
- [x] Store assignee name in subtasks table ✅

**API Changes Implemented:**
- [x] GET /api/users/all - fetches users with active access to Fulfillment app (app_id = 5) via user_app_access join ✅
- [x] POST /api/clients/:id/subtasks already accepted assignee parameter ✅
- [x] PATCH /api/subtasks/:id/assignee - changes assignee on existing subtasks ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `server.js` - Added GET /api/users/all and PATCH /api/subtasks/:id/assignee endpoints with app-specific filtering
- `public/index.html` - Added assignee dropdown to subtask creation with CSS styling
- `public/app.js` - Updated addSubtask function and loadSubtasksIntoModal to handle assignee selection

**Database Architecture:**
- Uses shared Sincro database with user_app_access table for cross-app access control
- Fulfillment app (app_id = 5) only shows users with active=TRUE for that app
- Prevents showing users from other Sincro apps (Maintenance, Access, etc.)

**Completed:** October 31, 2025
**User Testing:** ✅ Verified in production

## 📝 QUESTIONS FOR USER

4. **Slack channel name(s):** Where should notifications be posted?
5. **Notification triggers:** Which events should send Slack messages?
6. **Slack summary format:** What information should be included?
7. **Integration type:** Webhook (simple) or Bot API (advanced)?

9. **Auto-created subtasks:** Who should they be assigned to by default?

### Permissions:
10. **Sales role clarification:** Can sales users see ALL client tiles, or only ones they created?
