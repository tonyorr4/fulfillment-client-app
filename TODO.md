## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. Form Data Not Persisting to Client Tiles
**Status:** 🔧 Partially Fixed - Testing Required
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical
**Issue:** When a new client request is submitted, the form input data is not appearing on the completed client tile. Client detail modal was showing hardcoded mock data.

**Progress:**
- [x] Audited form field names - ALL MATCH server expectations ✅
- [x] Added comprehensive debugging logging throughout the data flow ✅
- [x] Removed ALL hardcoded data from client detail modal sidebar ✅
- [x] Fully implemented updateSidebarFields() function to populate real data ✅
- [ ] User testing required to verify tiles and detail modal show correct data
- [ ] Need Railway logs from user's submission to verify data flow

**Debugging Added:**
- ✅ POST /api/clients: Log request body received
- ✅ POST /api/clients: Log clientData before database insert
- ✅ POST /api/clients: Log newClient after database insert
- ✅ GET /api/clients: Log clients fetched and sent to frontend
- ✅ Frontend: Log clients received from API
- ✅ Frontend: Log data used to create each card

**Next Steps:**
1. User submits a new client request in deployed app
2. Check Railway logs to see what data is received/stored
3. Check browser console (F12) to see what data frontend receives
4. Identify where data is lost or incorrect
5. Apply fix

**Files Modified:**
- `server.js` - Added logging to POST /api/clients and GET /api/clients
- `public/app.js` - Added logging to loadAllClients and createClientCardElement

### 2. Sales Team Assignment Shows "Loading" on Tiles
**Status:** 🔍 Investigating - Need Logs
**Priority:** 🔴 Critical
**Issue:** The "Assigned To" section on client tiles shows "Loading..." instead of the actual sales team member name. New Request dropdown may not be loading sales team members correctly.

**Progress:**
- [x] Verified sales_team field is in form and being sent to server ✅
- [x] Verified createClientCardElement uses client.sales_team to display ✅
- [x] Added debugging to log sales_team value at each step ✅
- [ ] Need to check if openNewRequestModal() is successfully loading sales team members
- [ ] Need Railway logs to see if sales_team is NULL or contains actual name
- [ ] Testing to confirm sales_team is stored and retrieved (WAITING FOR USER TO TEST)

**Hypothesis:**
Either:
1. sales_team is NULL/undefined in database (not being stored)
2. sales_team is stored but not returned by getAllClients query
3. Frontend is receiving sales_team but getInitials() returns "?"

**Debugging Added:**
- ✅ Server logs will show sales_team value in request body
- ✅ Server logs will show sales_team value being stored
- ✅ Server logs will show sales_team value being returned
- ✅ Frontend logs will show sales_team value received
- ✅ Card creation logs will show sales_team value used

**Files to Check:**
- `database.js` - getAllClients query (verify sales_team is in SELECT)
- `public/app.js` - createClientCardElement (line ~131)
- `public/app.js` - getInitials function (line ~712)

## 📝 QUESTIONS FOR USER

### Email Notifications:
1. **For Tony's notifications:** Do you want individual emails for each event, or a daily digest summary?

3. **Email templates:** Do you have specific branding/formatting requirements for emails?

### Slack Integration:
4. **Slack channel name(s):** Where should notifications be posted?
5. **Notification triggers:** Which events should send Slack messages?
6. **Slack summary format:** What information should be included?
7. **Integration type:** Webhook (simple) or Bot API (advanced)?

### Subtask Assignment:
8. **Default assignee:** Should new subtasks default to the fulfillment ops person, or the current user?
9. **Auto-created subtasks:** Who should they be assigned to by default?

### Permissions:
10. **Sales role clarification:** Can sales users see ALL client tiles, or only ones they created?
11. **Viewer role:** Are viewers read-only for everything, or can they view specific tiles?
