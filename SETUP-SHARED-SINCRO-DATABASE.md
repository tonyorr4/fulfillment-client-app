# üö® CRITICAL: Setup Shared Sincro Database

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Purpose:** Connect Fulfillment Client App to shared Sincro OAuth ecosystem
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è MANUAL RAILWAY CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PROBLEM: Access Requests Not Appearing?

**Symptom:** Access requests submitted to fulfillment app don't show up in Sincro Access App

**Root Cause:** Fulfillment app is using its own separate database instead of the shared Sincro database

**Solution:** Update Railway environment variables (instructions below)

---

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done (Code-side)

1. **Updated authentication code** to use proper Sincro OAuth access control
2. **Updated ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md** with shared database and OAuth credentials
3. **Updated OAUTH-AND-ACCESS-COMPLETE-SYSTEM.md** to include Fulfillment app
4. **Fixed security vulnerability** where any Google user could auto-login

---

## üîß REQUIRED MANUAL ACTIONS (DO THIS NOW)

### 1. Add OAuth Redirect URI to Google Cloud Console

**You must do this manually:**

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Select project: **Sincro Automation Apps**
3. Click on OAuth 2.0 Client ID: `867246022081-6cjf9qnldp5i9al9ji0cj54cue95nn9t`
4. Scroll to **"Authorized redirect URIs"**
5. Click **"+ ADD URI"**
6. Add this exact URI:
   ```
   https://fulfillment-client-app-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback
   ```
7. Click **"SAVE"**

**‚ö†Ô∏è The app will not work until you do this!**

---

### 2. üö® UPDATE RAILWAY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (MOST IMPORTANT)

**THIS IS THE CRITICAL STEP - Without this, access requests won't appear in Sincro Access App!**

#### Steps:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Click on your **fulfillment-client-app** service
   - Click **"Variables"** tab

2. **Find These 3 Variables and Update Them:**

   Get the actual values from: `C:\Users\Tony\automations\OAUTH-AND-ACCESS-COMPLETE-SYSTEM.md`

   | Variable | What to Change | Why |
   |----------|----------------|-----|
   | `DATABASE_URL` | Change from `maglev.proxy...` to `metro.proxy...` | Connects to shared Sincro database |
   | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Update to shared Sincro OAuth Client ID | Uses centralized OAuth |
   | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Update to shared Sincro OAuth Client Secret | Uses centralized OAuth |

   **Current value example (WRONG):**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:...@maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:49885/railway
   ```

   **Should be (CORRECT):**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:...@metro.proxy.rlwy.net:49366/railway
   ```
   *(Get exact value from OAUTH-AND-ACCESS-COMPLETE-SYSTEM.md)*

3. **Add if Missing:**

   | Variable | Value |
   |----------|-------|
   | `AUTO_ADMIN_EMAIL` | `tony.orr@easyship.com` |

4. **Save and Wait:**
   - Railway will **automatically redeploy** when you change variables
   - Go to **"Deployments"** tab
   - Wait for green checkmark (1-2 minutes)
   - Check logs for: "Server running on port XXXX"

---

## üéØ What This Achieves

### Before (Insecure):
- ‚ùå Anyone with a Google account could access the app
- ‚ùå No approval process
- ‚ùå Access requests not visible anywhere
- ‚ùå Isolated database

### After (Secure):
- ‚úÖ Only `tony.orr@easyship.com` gets instant admin access
- ‚úÖ All other users must request access
- ‚úÖ Access requests appear in your Sincro Access App
- ‚úÖ Centralized user management across all Sincro apps
- ‚úÖ Users approved once can access all Sincro apps

---

## üß™ Testing After Setup

### Test 1: Tony's Access (Should Work Instantly)
1. Go to https://fulfillment-client-app-production.up.railway.app
2. Sign in with `tony.orr@easyship.com`
3. Should get instant access to Kanban board ‚úÖ

### Test 2: Other User (Should Request Access)
1. Sign out and sign in with `sincro-reply@gosincro.com` (or any other email)
2. Should see access request form
3. Fill out department and reason
4. Submit request
5. Go to https://sincro-access-app-production.up.railway.app
6. Should see the access request in "Access Requests" tab ‚úÖ
7. Approve the user
8. User can now access the fulfillment app ‚úÖ

---

## üìä Database Structure

The shared Sincro database now contains:

**Shared Tables (used by all Sincro apps):**
- `users` - All approved users across all apps
- `access_requests` - All access requests from all apps
- `audit_log` - Audit trail for all authentication events

**Fulfillment-Specific Tables:**
- `clients` - Fulfillment client requests
- `comments` - Comments on clients
- `subtasks` - Subtasks for clients
- `activity_log` - Activity log for client actions

All apps see the same users, but each app has its own business logic tables.

---

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Do NOT delete the old PostgreSQL service** in Railway until you've verified everything works
2. **The old database data will NOT be migrated automatically** - if you have important data, you'll need to export and import it
3. **Existing users in the old database** will need to be re-approved in the shared system
4. **Railway will auto-redeploy** when you change environment variables

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Added OAuth redirect URI to Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Updated `DATABASE_URL` in Railway to shared Sincro database
- [ ] Updated `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in Railway (if needed)
- [ ] Updated `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in Railway (if needed)
- [ ] Added `AUTO_ADMIN_EMAIL` to Railway
- [ ] Waited for Railway deployment to complete
- [ ] Tested login with tony.orr@easyship.com (instant access)
- [ ] Tested login with another email (access request form shown)
- [ ] Submitted test access request
- [ ] Verified request appears in Sincro Access App
- [ ] Approved test user in Sincro Access App
- [ ] Verified approved user can now access fulfillment app

## üîç Troubleshooting: How to Check If You're Using the Wrong Database

### Symptom: Access requests still not appearing in Sincro Access App

**Quick Check:**

1. Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí fulfillment-client-app ‚Üí Variables tab
2. Look at `DATABASE_URL` value
3. Check the hostname:
   - ‚ùå **WRONG:** `maglev.proxy.rlwy.net` (your own separate database)
   - ‚úÖ **CORRECT:** `metro.proxy.rlwy.net` (shared Sincro database)

**Database Hostname Reference:**

| Hostname | What It Is | Result |
|----------|------------|--------|
| `maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:49885` | Your separate Railway PostgreSQL | ‚ùå Access requests go here (invisible to Sincro Access App) |
| `metro.proxy.rlwy.net:49366` | Shared Sincro database | ‚úÖ Access requests go here (visible in Sincro Access App) |

### Common Error: "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND base"

**This error means your DATABASE_URL is malformed!**

**Symptoms in logs:**
```
Failed to start server: Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND base
hostname: 'base'
```

**Fix:**
1. Go to Railway ‚Üí fulfillment-client-app ‚Üí Variables tab
2. Check the `DATABASE_URL` value
3. **Problem:** It's NOT the full connection string
4. **Solution:** Replace with the COMPLETE connection string from `C:\Users\Tony\automations\OAUTH-AND-ACCESS-COMPLETE-SYSTEM.md`

**What NOT to put:**
- ‚ùå `base`
- ‚ùå `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`
- ‚ùå `See OAUTH-AND-ACCESS-COMPLETE-SYSTEM.md`
- ‚ùå Any placeholder text

**What TO put:**
- ‚úÖ The full connection string: `postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@metro.proxy.rlwy.net:49366/railway`

### Still Having Issues?

1. **Check Railway logs:**
   - Go to Deployments ‚Üí Click latest deployment ‚Üí View logs
   - Look for: "Server running on port XXXX"
   - Any database connection errors?

2. **Verify DATABASE_URL format:**
   ```
   Should start with: postgresql://
   Should contain: metro.proxy.rlwy.net:49366
   Should NOT be: base, ${{...}}, or placeholder text
   ```

3. **Verify Google OAuth redirect URI:**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Check if `https://fulfillment-client-app-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback` is added

4. **Test database connection manually:**
   ```bash
   # On your local machine, test if you can connect to shared database
   psql "postgresql://postgres:...@metro.proxy.rlwy.net:49366/railway"
   ```

5. **Check if tables exist:**
   ```sql
   -- Should see access_requests table in shared database
   SELECT * FROM access_requests WHERE status = 'pending';
   ```

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Waiting for manual Railway configuration
**Next:** Update Railway variables and test
**Help:** If still stuck, check Railway logs and verify DATABASE_URL hostname
