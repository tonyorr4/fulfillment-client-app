## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit & Push to GitHub

```bash
cd C:\Users\Tony\automations\fulfillment_client_app

# Check status
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Add dynamic automation system

- Created automations and automation_logs tables
- Built automation engine with advanced condition evaluation
- Added automation management API (admin-only)
- Integrated automations into client creation, status changes, etc.
- Added Automations tab in UI with view/toggle/delete
- Created default automations to replicate existing behavior
- Removed all hard-coded automation logic

New features:
- Admins can now manage automations without code changes
- Enable/disable automations instantly
- Full execution logging for debugging
- Audit trail for all automated actions

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Step 2: Run Migrations on Railway

Railway will automatically redeploy when you push. Once deployed:

#### Option A: Via Railway Web Terminal (Recommended)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Select your Fulfillment app
3. Click "Deployments" ‚Üí Latest deployment ‚Üí "View Logs"
4. Click "Terminal" tab (or open shell)
5. Run migrations:

```bash
# Create automation tables
node migrations/add-automation-system.js

# Seed default automations
node migrations/seed-default-automations.js
```

#### Option B: Via Local Script (if database is accessible)

If you have the production `DATABASE_URL` in your local `.env`:

```bash
# Make sure .env has production DATABASE_URL
node migrations/add-automation-system.js
node migrations/seed-default-automations.js
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Login to your app** (as Tony - admin user)
2. **Check for Automations tab** - Should appear in the top navigation
3. **Click Automations tab** - Should show 3 default automations:
   - Auto-assign Ian to fulfillment ops
   - Auto-approve simple clients
   - Create client setup subtasks
4. **Test toggle** - Try disabling/enabling an automation
5. **Create a test client** - Verify automations execute:
   - Ian should be auto-assigned
   - Simple clients should auto-approve

### Step 4: Monitor Logs

Check Railway logs for automation execution:

```
ü§ñ Triggering automations for client_created event...
‚úì Automations completed: 2/2 executed, 3 actions performed
```

## üîç Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Auto-Approval (Simple Client)
- [ ] Create client with:
  - Battery: No
  - Pallets: 1-10
  - SKUs: 1-50
- [ ] Expected: Status = 'signing', auto_approved = true, fulfillment_ops = 'Ian'

### Test 2: Manual Review (Complex Client)
- [ ] Create client with:
  - Battery: Yes
  - Pallets: >100
  - SKUs: >100
- [ ] Expected: Status = 'new-request', auto_approved = false, fulfillment_ops = 'Ian'

### Test 3: Client Setup Subtasks
- [ ] Move any client to "Client Setup" status
- [ ] Expected: 2 subtasks auto-created:
  - "Security deposit confirmation" ‚Üí Assigned to sales team
  - "WMS Setup (Client and billing parameters)" ‚Üí Assigned to fulfillment ops

### Test 4: Automation Management
- [ ] Disable "Auto-approve simple clients" automation
- [ ] Create a simple client
- [ ] Expected: Status = 'new-request' (not auto-approved)
- [ ] Re-enable automation
- [ ] Create another simple client
- [ ] Expected: Status = 'signing' (auto-approved)

### Test 5: Deletion
- [ ] Try deleting an automation
- [ ] Confirm it's removed from list
- [ ] Verify trigger no longer fires

## üìä Default Automations Explained

### 1. Auto-Assign Ian to Fulfillment Ops
**Trigger:** Client Created
**Conditions:** None (always runs)
**Actions:** Set `fulfillment_ops` = "Ian"
**Execution Order:** 0 (runs first)

### 2. Auto-Approve Simple Clients
**Trigger:** Client Created
**Conditions:**
```
battery = "No" AND
num_pallets NOT IN ["50-100", ">100"] AND
num_skus NOT IN ["50-100", ">100"]
```
**Actions:**
- Set `status` = "signing"
- Set `auto_approved` = true
**Execution Order:** 1 (runs after Ian assignment)

### 3. Create Client Setup Subtasks
**Trigger:** Status Changed
**Conditions:** `status` = "client-setup"
**Actions:**
- Create subtask "Security deposit confirmation" (assign to sales_team)
- Create subtask "WMS Setup (Client and billing parameters)" (assign to fulfillment_ops)
**Execution Order:** 1

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Create New Automations

For now, automations are created via direct database inserts. The UI builder is a future enhancement.

### Example: Auto-assign to different person based on client type

```sql
INSERT INTO automations (name, description, trigger_event, conditions, actions, enabled, execution_order, created_by)
VALUES (
    'Assign dropship clients to Sarah',
    'Auto-assign Sarah as fulfillment ops for all dropship clients',
    'client_created',
    '{
        "type": "condition",
        "field": "client_type",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "Dropship"
    }'::jsonb,
    '[
        {
            "type": "set_field",
            "field": "fulfillment_ops",
            "value": "Sarah"
        }
    ]'::jsonb,
    true,
    2,
    (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'tony.orr@easyship.com')
);
```

### Available Condition Operators
- `equals`, `not_equals`
- `greater_than`, `less_than`, `greater_or_equal`, `less_or_equal`
- `contains`, `not_contains`
- `in`, `not_in` (for array values)
- `is_empty`, `is_not_empty`
- `is_true`, `is_false`

### Available Action Types
1. **set_field** - Update a single field
   ```json
   {
       "type": "set_field",
       "field": "status",
       "value": "signing"
   }
   ```

2. **create_subtask** - Create a subtask
   ```json
   {
       "type": "create_subtask",
       "text": "Task description",
       "assignee_field": "sales_team",
       "mark_auto_created": true
   }
   ```

3. **set_multiple_fields** - Update multiple fields at once
   ```json
   {
       "type": "set_multiple_fields",
       "fields": {
           "status": "signing",
           "auto_approved": true
       }
   }
   ```

### Trigger Events
- `client_created` - When a new client is created
- `status_changed` - When status is updated
- `approval_changed` - When client_approved is updated
- `subtask_completed` - When a subtask is marked complete
- `client_updated` - When client details are edited

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Automation Not Executing
1. **Check if enabled:** Automations tab ‚Üí verify toggle is ON
2. **Check logs:** Railway logs should show "ü§ñ Triggering automations..."
3. **Check conditions:** Review condition logic in automation card
4. **Check execution order:** Lower numbers run first (0, 1, 2...)

### Automations Tab Not Visible
- Only admins can see this tab
- Check user has `is_admin = true` or `role = 'Admin'`
- Tony's email (tony.orr@easyship.com) auto-gets admin

### Migration Errors
- Check DATABASE_URL is correct
- Ensure you're connected to production database
- Check if tables already exist (migrations are idempotent)

### Conflicting Automations
- If two automations set the same field, **last one wins** (higher execution_order)
- Use execution_order to control priority
- Example: Order 0 runs before Order 1

## üìà Future Enhancements

The rule builder modal was planned but deprioritized for now. Future improvements:

### Phase 2 (Future)
- [ ] Visual automation builder (3-step wizard)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop condition builder
- [ ] Edit existing automations in UI
- [ ] Duplicate/clone automations
- [ ] Test automation with sample data
- [ ] Automation analytics dashboard
- [ ] Email action support
- [ ] Webhook action support

### How to Add Rule Builder Later
1. Create modal with 3 steps (Basic Info ‚Üí Conditions ‚Üí Actions)
2. Build condition tree UI with nested groups
3. Add action form builder
4. Call `POST /api/automations` with payload
5. Update `openAutomationModal()` in app.js

---

## üéØ Key Decisions Made

Based on your answers:

1. **Execution conflicts:** Last automation wins (higher execution_order)
2. **Failed automations:** Continue to next, log error (don't stop)
3. **Audit trail:** Yes - all automation actions logged to activity_log
4. **Manual overrides:** Respected - automations don't re-trigger on manual changes
5. **Later execution:** Automation B can override Automation A if higher order
6. **Multi-admin:** Future admins can edit automations

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Railway logs** - Look for automation execution logs
2. **Check automation_logs table** - Query for error messages
3. **Disable problematic automation** - Use toggle in UI
4. **Review automation_todo.md** - Full technical documentation

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Deployment
**Next Step:** Run migrations on Railway

Good luck! üöÄ
