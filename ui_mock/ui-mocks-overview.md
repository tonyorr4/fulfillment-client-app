## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Open each HTML file and interact with the mocks
2. **Gather Feedback**: Show to your team and get their preferences
3. **Decide**: Pick your favorite (or combine elements from multiple)
4. **Implement**: Let me know which direction you want to go, and I can help update the production app

**Note**: All mocks maintain the same core functionality as your current app:
- Same data fields
- Same status workflow (8 stages)
- Role-based permissions compatible
- Drag-and-drop between statuses
- Modal detail views
- Search/filter capabilities

The differences are purely **visual and organizational** - the underlying data structure and features remain intact.
